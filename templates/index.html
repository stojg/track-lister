    This website is a mini-application that list all the songs from a Spotify playlist and displays an optional (non-affiliated) Beatport search link.

    The reason I made this is that I use Spotify as one of the tools to find music to add to my DJ sets. In the past, it was possible to purchase songs directly via Spotify.

    Copy-pasting or retyping search terms into Beatport for purchasing them there is also a giant pain. So this little app makes it much more convenient for me to spend money. One would imagine that stores like Beatport would have a playlist import/purchase functionality.
